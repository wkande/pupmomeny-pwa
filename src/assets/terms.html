 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <p>We are sorry for the rules, but hey, we did not create the bureaucracy that seemingly grows without any common sense. 
     We could have used the typical babbling lawyer speak which says the same thing we have stated in plain people talk. 
     At least we are honest and up-front about it.  
 </p>

 <p>Sorry as well for the use of CAPS. We are not trying to shout at you.</p>

 <p>If you are confused please email us at 
     supportme@pupmoney.com
